# Simple C++ Text Editor Using Stacks

A simple text editor written in C++ with redo and undo features that are implemented using stacks. Along with my code are a few text files I used for testing.

## Files Included
text-editor: contains 'main.cpp' to run program  
testing: contains text files used for testing

## Text Editor Commands 
**t**: type a word  
**u**: undo the previous word typed  
**r**: redo the previous word that was undone

## Program Input Format 
'x' lines  
command string(if command is 't')  
command string(if command is 't')  
.  
.    
for 'x' lines

## Program Output
The words typed will be output on the first line  
The words that were undone and not redone will be output on the second line
